<h3>Thanks for your interest in gleaning!</h3>

<p> Before you head out to farms, we’d like to know how best to contact you, where you’re interested in gleaning, and your emergency contact.</p>

<p>Enter a username for logging in and posting comments to the rideshare board –choose something you’re comfortable with other registered volunteers viewing.</p>

<i>How and when will I be contacted? </i>
<p>After filling out this form you’ll receive a confirmation email from the Interface – but gleaning organizations cannot email you until after you RSVP for an event they’re hosting…and they cannot view any of your contact information until after you actually attend a glean. Only once you’ve put in hours with an organization may they send additional correspondence.</p>

<p>We also ask that every volunteer sign a waiver of liability and volunteer agreement before entering any farm fields – please read the text below and consider whether you can commit to these agreements.</p>
 <h5>Waiver of Liability</h5>
